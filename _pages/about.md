Experienced academic researcher, teacher, and leader who is passionate about using cutting-edge artificial intelligence 🧠 to reveal the underpinnings of the human brain 🧬 utilizing sleep-wake electrophysiology, neuroimaging, and neuromodulation.

---
I’m building a research team to explore and develop innovative solutions at the intersection of  **artificial intelligence**, **signal processing**, **control systems**, **neurophysiology**, and **neuroscience**.

✅ What You Get (Pros)

- I’ll be working `alongside` you (I’m hands-on).
- Access to a strong network and datasets through international collaborators-with potential internship opportunities.
- Mentorship for both academic and industry-oriented projects.
- Opportunities to publish, prototype, and even explore commercialization.
- Flexibility and accommodation for any reasonable requests.

⚠️ What You Put Up With (Cons)

- A bit of `persistence` when it comes to motivation.
- Strong opinions about signal filtering.
- Possibly too much coffee.

 Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.




Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
