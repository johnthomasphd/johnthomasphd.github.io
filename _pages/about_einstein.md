Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite subreddit: [reddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already inâ€”just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing the `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`.

Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/). Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
